## General Information
- This project was used to create my website so I can showcase my portfolio and provide a way for people on the internet to find and contact me.
- It was important that I created this website as I began my career in business analytics so I can have a designated domain.


## Technologies Used
- Used Spurgeon website template, designed by StyleShout (https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/spurgeon/)
- I used GitHub Desktop, Visual Studio Code, and Azure Web Apps to edit the code, push it to GitHub, and display it on the Internet. 

## Features
- My website has three pages: Home, About, and Contact


## Setup
The template is what I initally used to obtain the code. All of the code can be found in the repoistory. I edited to code as needed for the website. 
The css folder contains the stylings that were used for the website. The index.html file contains code about the 'Home' page, about.html contains code for the 'About' page, and contact.html contains code for the 'Contact' page. 

Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project.


## Project Status
Project is: complete, as of now! I will be editing it and adding more information as I begin and continue my career.
